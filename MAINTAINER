MAINTAINER
==========

Frodi is maintained by the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science in
Iceland. Its main purpose is to serve as an educational gateway and curricula
management system for the Icelandic educational system but it should be easy
to adapt it to other systems. Maintainers can therefore be different based on
the different educational systems.
